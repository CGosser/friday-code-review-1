    <h3>About me</h3>
    <h4>A bit of background</h4>
    <p>I am fairly new to web development, but I learn quickly and as an end user I have made a bit of a hobby of experiencing the best and worst of web design. I personally enjoy <a href="http://brutalistwebsites.com/">Brutalist</a> web design, although I am aware that lighter and softer websites are more pleasant for every day use. I have experience working for business process outsourcing companies where worked in the accounts of a number of major companies that you may own the products of yourself, but which I cannot disclose the names of due to non disclosure agreements. I have some limited experience with Python, in addition to the languages we are learning here. </p>
    <h4>Hobbies</h4>
    <p>Outside of work I enjoy industrial music and beer, and I make a hobby of cycling and rock climbing, and snowboarding when I can get up to a mountain.</p>
    <h5>A few industrial bands that I would recommend</h5>
    <ul>
      <li>KMFDM</li>
      <li>Front 242</li>
      <li>Front Line Assembly</li>
      <li>Bigod 20</li>
      <li>Chemlab</li>
      <li>Laibach</li>
      <li>Nitzer Ebb</li>
    </ul>
  </div>
    <p>I'm a seventh generation Oregonion, an interesting bit of local history is that my family owned the Bodega Saloon on 1st street in Portland in the 1880s.</p>
